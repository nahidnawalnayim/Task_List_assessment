## Project Structure:

The project will be organized with separate folders for components, actions, reducers, Redux store setup, Tailwind CSS configuration, and the main application page (index.js).

## Technologies:
Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
Redux: A predictable state management library for JavaScript applications.
Redux Persist: An add-on for Redux that enables persistence of state across page reloads.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Redux Setup:
A Redux store will be created to manage the application's state, including the todo list, filter options, and search term.
Reducers will handle actions dispatched from components to update the state based on user interactions.
Redux Persist will be integrated to automatically save the state (e.g., localStorage) for persistence across page reloads.
Components:

The main Todo component will render the overall application layout and manage user input for adding new todos.
A TodoList component will display the list of todos, potentially implementing filtering and searching functionalities based on user input.
A TodoItem component will represent an individual todo, providing functionality for checking completion, editing (optional), and removal.
Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS will provide utility classes for styling the application's UI elements.
A global stylesheet (globals.css) will import the base styles and components from Tailwind CSS.

## Workflow:
Users can add new todo items by entering text in an input field and clicking a button.
Upon adding a todo, the addTodo action will be dispatched, updating the Redux state.
The TodoList component will receive the updated list of todos from the Redux store and render the list items.
Users can interact with individual todos (e.g., marking them complete, removing them) by triggering actions that update the state.
Redux Persist ensures that the current state of the todo list is saved to the chosen storage mechanism (e.g., localStorage) for persistence across page reloads.
